# test_shortner

The best way to learn is experimenting.
I am trying to build shortner (or something alike) with 2 services (admin, redirect).

If you can point something that I am doing wrong - feel free to write.

It's not a good idea, but for learning purpose I decided to make 2 services at 1 repo: webinterface + redirector. In production it's better to place services in different modules to deploy easily on different servers.
